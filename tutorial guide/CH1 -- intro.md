# CH1 -- intro
## objectives

+ introduction of T4

## CH1.1 -- what is T4
`T4` stands for `Text Template Transformation Toolkit`

`T4` is a powerful tool that can generate `T-SQL` Query (`.sql` file)

with given T4 template file (`.tt` file).

executing generated `T-SQL` Query can automatically generate beans (usually a script written in `C#`)

in `Visual Studio`.

## pro
Since given T4 template file,

it can generate these in `Visual Studio`.

+ `T-SQL` Query (`.sql` file)

+ beans (usually a script written in `C#`)

So, `T4` can offer these pros

+ No manually write a bean

+ Automatically refreshes the bean (refresh when you save `.tt` file and build the project.)

## cons
However,

+ it is harder to learn than `T-SQL` Query 

(even you are familar with `T-SQL` Query, 

`C#`, 

the core concept and design of programming such as `namespace` and `OOP` design pattern).

+ its learning curve might be slower
