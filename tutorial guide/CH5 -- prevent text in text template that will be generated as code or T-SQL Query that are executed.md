# CH5 -- prevent text in text template that will be generated as code or T-SQL Query that are executed 
## CH5.1 -- move the comments into Statement Block
In CH4, we have discussed that 

+ in a Statement Block, we `C#` comments to comment

For example,

If I want to describe following 

```
<#@ import namespace="System.Text" #>
```

we can add comment in a Statement Block like this

```
<#@ import namespace="System.Text" #>
<# 
    /*
        import `System.Text` in Text Template
    */
#>
```

> [!CAUTION]
> It is **impossible** to embed comments inside a **Directive Block**.
> 
> Otherwise, it will get parser error.
>
> For example,
>
> ```
> <#@ template language="C#" // This is not allowed here #>
> <#@ output extension=".txt" /* Nor is this */ #>
> ```

## CH5.2 -- `#if` preprocessor directives
Since there is [`#if`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives#conditional-compilation) preprocessor directives in `C#`,

we can use `#if` preprocessor directives inside Statement Block to 

determine that the script (usually written in `C#`) or `T-SQL` Query generated by `T4` will be executed. 

> [!TIP]
> `#if` preprocessor directives
> 
> behaves as `if` built-in function in `C#`,
>
> but the conditional statement with `#if` preprocessor directives will be processed with preprocessor before compile time.

For example,

```
<#@ template language="C#" #>
<#@ output extension=".txt" #>

<#
    #if(debug)
    {
        // ... your logic here.
    }
#>
```
